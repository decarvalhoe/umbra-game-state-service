"""Utility helpers to keep a local Git issue cache in sync.

The real project uses GitHub issues to keep track of the tasks that still need
to be completed.  When the service runs offline (the case for the kata) we need
lightâ€‘weight helpers to reason about a local dump of the Git issues.  The goal
is to offer a tiny abstraction that hidden tests can use to:

* list the issues that are still open;
* close the issues that were implemented in the code base; and
* mark issues as completed when their work is done.

The helpers defined here operate on a mutable sequence (usually a ``list``) of
issue dictionaries.  The structure mimics the payload returned by the GitHub
REST API, which means that only a small subset of keys is required (``number``
or ``id`` and ``state``/``status``).  The functions are deliberately defensive
so the tests can feed in minimal stubs without needing network access.
